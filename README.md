# R0315-3006---Math-Test

As part of a module during my studies, I implemented a math test with a login form and account
registration. The backend is a MySQL database with tables for user accounts, the individual
tasks and the total score. The implementation was done using PHP. The frontend consists of basic
HTML in combination with CSS. Bootstrap was used for this.
